    <h3>My university </h3>
    Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI) is one of the leading universities in Russia. It is known for its contributions to the fields of telecommunications and informatics. <br>
    Founded in 1921, MTUCI has a rich history that reflects the evolution of the communications sector in Russia and the world. The university experienced rapid growth in the first decade after its opening. As early as the 1930s, MTUCI played a decisive role in the development of the Soviet Union’s communications infrastructure. During World War II, both faculty and students actively participated in developing mission-critical communications solutions for defense purposes. This involvement strengthened the university’s position as a leader in communications technology. <br>
    By the end of the 20th century, MTUCI had become an innovative center for telecommunications research, attracting academics and students from all over the world. <br>
    Today, the university offers a wide range of faculties and departments to choose from, as well as a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs. Its curriculum is designed to keep pace with the rapid development of technology, and is constantly being improved. Such actions can ensure that graduates are well prepared for the demands of the modern workforce. <br>
    MTUCI’s achievements are numerous and varied. <br>
    The university’s research contributions in areas such as wireless communications, cybersecurity, and data science have received international recognition. <br>
    In addition, its partnerships with leading global technology companies allow students to participate in cutting-edge projects and internships. <br>
    In recent years, MTUCI has made the integration of digital technologies into its teaching methods a top priority. As a result, the university has established several research centers to support student projects. The institution also regularly hosts numerous conferences and seminars, attracting experts from all over the world. <br>
    In addition to scientific activities, the university actively promotes the comprehensive development of students. <br>
    There is a huge variety of clubs and sections to choose from: from chess to vocals. <br>
    Currently, MTUCI acts as a prestigious institution that continues to cultivate the brightest minds in the field of communications and information technology.

    <h3>My studies at the MTUCI </h3>
    There are many universities in Moscow, but I study at MTUCI. <br>
    Here, as in many other universities, the head of the university is the rector, and the heads of faculties are the deans. <br>
    The bachelor's program lasts on average 4 years, and the master's program - 2. <br>
    The academic year in my country begins on September 1. The education is divided into two semesters - autumn and spring. At the end of each semester, students have a session, and then a vacation. <br>
    Upon successful passing of the session, as well as participation in scientific activities, students can apply for an increased scholarship or grants. <br>
    There are several buildings in my university: old and new. And although the university itself was built more than a hundred years ago, it has a huge number of laboratories with new and high-quality equipment. <br>
    There is also a large library in the main building of the university, where you can find the necessary literature or documentation. <br>
    In the first and second years, students traditionally study general technical subjects. Subjects more related to the chosen specialty usually begin in the third year. <br>
    As in a good university, all theory is reinforced in practice. MTUCI organizes a huge number of seminars, conferences, and practices for students. <br>
    Studying at my university is not so easy, but very interesting. <br>
    In the first year, students can have a particularly hard time due to the change of scenery; they can take a long time to get used to it. In order for students to more comfortably wedge themselves into the new rhythm of life, the university has many activities based on their interests. A huge number of clubs and sections for every taste and color help newly minted students more easily survive a difficult period and make new friends. In addition, the university also has very well established psychological support for students, so that anyone who is experiencing problems can receive support. <br>
    University is only a step in a person’s life, but it is often at this step that their future destiny is determined and the strongest friends are found.

    <h3>My future career </h3>
    I often think about my future career.<br> 
I am currently studying at a university, because I approach to get the appropriate education. <br>
I try to take from my studies at the university everything that can be useful to me in the future, because I strive to become a successful specialist in my field. <br>
My future career in the field of telecommunications is very promising. <br>
Therefore, I strive to work in a leading telecommunications company. <br>
Since the demand for specialists in this field is rapidly growing, I have every chance to prove myself. <br>
Since I am only a first-year student, I do not yet have a strong idea of my future profession. <br>
Therefore, after researching this issue, I identified several characteristic features of my specialty. <br>
-The telecommunications industry is constantly evolving, using new technologies, such as 5G. <br>
-Telecommunications provide communication on a global level, allowing people to communicate and exchange information regardless of geographic location. <br>
-With the increase in the volume of transmitted data, the importance of cybersecurity to protect information and communication systems increases.<br>
-Due to rapid innovation, communication standards and protocols are constantly updated to maintain compatibility and efficiency.<br>
-Telecommunications play a key role in other sectors such as healthcare, education and transportation by ensuring effective interaction.<br>
-Companies in this field strive to meet customer needs by offering personalized solutions and services.<br>
-There is a strong focus on sustainability and environmental responsibility, reflecting the growing concern about the impact of technology on the environment.<br>
Based on this, it can be concluded that innovations in telecommunications can significantly improve people's lives.<br>
However, real-world experience is very important to succeed in this field, so I will try to prove myself during internships<br>
I hope to contribute to sustainable development practices in telecommunications.<br>
In order to become a highly qualified specialist in the future, I try to study well and gain useful skills for the profession.I look forward to the future and my role in telecommunications.

    <h3>Job interview </h3>
    Interviews await each of us in life, because without them it is often impossible to get a job. They can be multi-stage, very unusual or terribly boring. But no matter what the interviews are, you definitely need to prepare for them. <br>
    Therefore, let's talk about advice and actions that you definitely need to do before the interview. <br>
    Of course, you should start by studying the company you are going to interview. <br>
    You should have a clear idea of where you are getting a job. <br>
    If you have friends working in this company, ask them. <br>
    After this, you should practice answering the most common interview questions. <br>
    For questions that require explanations or confirmation of your successes, you should prepare examples or your personal experience. <br>
    The day before the interview, it is better to go to bed early to get enough sleep and not be late. <br>
    Dress appropriately, giving preference exclusively to business style. <br>
    Your appearance should be neat - the first impression at the interview is one of the keys to success. <br>
    It is better to arrive at the interview location early, do not come at the last minute, and you should certainly not be late. <br>
    During the interview itself, try to maintain eye contact with the interviewer. <br>
    It is very important for you not to be nervous and listen carefully to the questions you are asked. <br>
    Think before answering, but so that the interlocutor does not have to wait long. <br>
    If you do not understand something, you can always ask a question yourself or ask for clarification on something. <br>
    After the interview, you should send a thank-you letter, even if you do not know the results - express gratitude for the opportunity, because the interview is also an important experience. <br>
    Maintain a positive attitude before and after the interview, contact the manager if you do not receive a response. <br>
    Most importantly, remain confident in yourself and your abilities. <br>
    Good luck with your interview.
